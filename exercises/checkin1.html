        <h1>What is Boba?</h1>
        <p>Boba (also known as bubble tea) is a popular Taiwanese drink made with tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls. Originating as a tasty sweet treat, boba has evolved into an aesthetic, customizable, and trendy cultural beverage enjoyed worldwide.</p>

        <h2>History of Boba</h2>
        <p>Boba was invented in the 1980s in Taiwan, with two competing stories about its origin. One story credits Lin Hsiu Hui, who added tapioca pearls to her tea at a tea stand, while another credits Tu Tsong-he, who created a similar drink using white tapioca pearls. Both versions of the story highlight the creativity and innovation that led to the creation of boba.</p>
