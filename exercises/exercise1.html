        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Hey, I'm Sammie,</h2>
        <p>a UX/UI + Web Designer studying Human-Computer Interaction and Design at UMass Amherst. I transform creative technology, cognitive insight, and human–centered solutions into intuitive, impactful user experiences.</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>Complementing my major, I am pursuing a minor in Information Technology and certificate in Design and Creative Technologies. With this background, I plan to pursue a career in UI/UX design or product design, with the long-term goal of working in product management.</p>
        <p>As someone intellectually curious with interests ranging from computer science to graphic design, I value interdisciplinary, self-directed learning. I aim to bridge the gap between logic and creativity to create innovative designs that not only meet user needs but also anticipate future possibilities. Ultimately, I hope to create user-friendly technologies and digital experiences that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also provide tangible solutions for specific user groups.</p>
